      For my walking project I had the class walk across a rectangle of bubblewrap
      twice. The first time I didn't let them know how long they were walking across
      it for, however it was 7 minutes. It seemed like a simple task however as time
      went on people were getting frustrated because it took a lot of energy/force to
      pop the bubbles. At the end of the time the class realized that they didn't pop as many bubbles
      as they thought. They were frustrated, but I gave them another chance to pop the bubblewrap.

      The second time I did not have a time limit in mind, I just told them to pop it until
      they thought they had actually popped all of the bubbles. People got very creative
      this time and it was interesting to see the different techniques people used to
      pop them. I was happy I gave people a second chance to pop the bubblewrap because
      it allowed for them to explore different methods of "walking" across the bubblewrap.
      They also knew how difficult it was going to be so they adjusted their methods.
