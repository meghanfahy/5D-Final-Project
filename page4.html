        This side represents my meaningful place which
        is my friend's apartment. This is a place where we
        always hang out and I have so many good memories here,
        which is why it is meaningful to me. On this side of the
        image I printed out words that represented topics my friends
       were talking about while I was sitting there.

          This side represents my meaningless place which
          is the Curry Student Center. This is a place where I never go
          on campus and I have no memories connected to it. On this side of the
          image I printed out words that represented topics the people sitting
          next to me were talking about while I was there.
